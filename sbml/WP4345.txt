This pathway is inspired by the Lipidmaps>Glycerolipids and Glycerophospholipids Pathways expended pathway display [https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps].
Glycerolipids are composed of mono-, di-, and tri-substituted glycerols, which all function as energy storage. 
Glycerophospholipids are also based on glycerol phospholipids, and serve as the main component of biological membranes.
