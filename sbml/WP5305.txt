Globoseries sphingolipid biosynthesis taken from Sphingomap.
Solid conversion arrows are documented according to Sphingomap. Thicker lines are those reactions not found in Rhea.
Dotted conversions are hypothetical, either not occurring or undocumented (Sphingomap details all possible permutations of a pathway to the final glycolipid) p
Numbers are the sphingomap IDs, to be converted. 
Metabolites with a dotted box are hypothetical. These may or may not exist on the pathway to the final product as several different routes could occur.
