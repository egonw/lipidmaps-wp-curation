This pathway is inspired by the Lipidmaps>Eicosanoids Pathway expended pathway display [https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps].
Eicosanoids are a large group of compounds metabolised from arachidonic acid (AA), either via cyclooxygenases (COX)[https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4347], lipooxygenases(LOX)[https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4348], or cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP)[https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4349].
This pathway visualises the second route, via LOX.
