This pathway is inspired by the Lipidmaps>Glycerolipids and Glycerophospholipids Pathways expended pathway display [https://lipidmaps.org/resources/pathways/vanted.php].
Glycerolipids are composed of mono-, di-, and tri-substituted glycerols, which all function as energy storage. 
Glycerophospholipids are also based on glycerol phospholipids, and serve as the main component of biological membranes.
This pathway was inferred from Mus musculus pathway [WP4345_106451.gpml] with a 95.0% conversion rate.
