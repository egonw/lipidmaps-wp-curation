Riboflavin (aka Vitamin B2) is used as molecular precursor for the formation of FAD and FMN, which are both essential cofactors in beta-oxidation, branched-chain-amino-acid catabolism and the mitochondrial electron transport of the TCA cycle.

Coenzyme Q10 (aka ubiquinone or CoQ10) functions as a electron carrier, antioxidant and influences pyrimidine metabolism directly.

This pathway was inspired by Chapter 16 (ed. 4) from the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
