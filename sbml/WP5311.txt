Isoglobo pathway in its entirety from [https://www.lipidmaps.org/resources/sphingomap SphinGOMAP].

Solid conversion arrows are documented according to Sphingomap. 
Dotted conversions are hypothetical, either not occurring or undocumented (Sphingomap details all possible permutations of a pathway to the final glycolipid).

Numbers represent the sphingomap IDs, to be converted.
Metabolites coloured red are not yet in LIPIDMAPS

Metabolites with a dotted box are hypothetical. These may or may not exist on the pathway to the final product as several different routes could occur.
