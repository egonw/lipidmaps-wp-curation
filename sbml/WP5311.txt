Isoglobo pathway in its entirety from SPhingomap

Solid conversion arrows are documented according to Sphingomap. 
Dotted conversions are hypothetical, either not occurring or undocumented (Sphingomap details all possible permutations of a pathway to the final glycolipid) Numbers are the sphingomap IDs, to be converted. Metabolites coloured red are not yet in LIPIDMAPS

Metabolites with a dotted box are hypothetical. These may or may not exist on the pathway to the final product as several different routes could occur.
